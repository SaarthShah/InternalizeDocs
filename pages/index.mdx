## What is Internalize?

Internalize is a low-code platform enabling companies to integrate recommendation systems into their products within minutes. By linking their existing databases to Internalize, companies can deploy custom recommendation models tailored to their specific use cases. This includes a range of applications such as e-commerce, social networks, search recommendations, streaming services, news, blogs, and travel websites.

With Internalize, users can build generalizable models or customize them by adjusting hyperparameters to suit their unique needs. Once trained, the models can generate instant recommendations with simple API calls. Furthermore, Internalize enables A/B testing of multiple model instances to determine which delivers the best conversion rates for a specific use case.
